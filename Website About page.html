                                Hi, I am Ivo van der Veen. I’m a guy who likes to program and make art. In the future I would
                                like to make games because that would combine both of my hobbies perfectly. And besides that,
                                making games does sound cool doesn’t it?

                    <p >
                        I started off programming when I was nine (2014).
                        The games I made back then were simple games made using <a
                            href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/30028780/">Scratch. </a>
                        After scratch I started learning to type my code using GameMaker.
                        The first game I finished using GameMaker was <a href="./games/duckgame/index.html">Duck
                            Game.</a>
                        I worked on it for more than a year and even released it to a little GitHub website when it was
                        done. (2017)
                        <br> <br>
                        Then things slowed down a bit since I had just switched from primary school to high school which took
                        some getting used to. The next year I made <a href="./games/privacy/Index.html"> Privacy Please,</a> (2018) which was the last game I made using GameMaker.
                        Afterwards I moved on to learning Unity and C#. I started many projects and games in unity but never saw one through to the end.
                        <br><br>
                        I started finishing things again when I started having computing science lessons at school. (2020) These were very basic and didn't pose much of a challenge to me, but they did motivate me to code more.
                        The teacher made us program in Qbasic, I picked up the language so fast that the teacher challenged me to recreate monopoly using the language which I did to his surprise.
                        <br><br>
                        The next year we used on to more useful things and started making websites using CSS and HTML. That is when this portfolio website started.
                        <br><br>
                        In the summer break after that year I started playing around with Arduinos and made rock paper scissors and <a href="Website WIP page.html"> a doorbell that sends messages on discord.</a>
                        The following year we learned about databases and I created <a href=""> Shape</a> a social media platform that used a database to store all its account and post data.
                        <br><br>
                        The last notable development in my coding experience is me starting to practice C++ since the start of 2022. This has led to a lot of practice programs <a href="./Other code projects/Shape/index.html">one of which I have featured on this site.</a>

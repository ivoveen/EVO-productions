                Learning C++ and SDL2
            </h1>
            <p>
                I made this matrix effect as an introduction to the SDL2 library and of course to practice my C++ skills.
                Making the effect was harder than I anticipated but it taught me a lot about the library and about pointers.
                <br> <br>
                The biggest problem I ran into while making the program took place at the end. 
                I had created my first ever data leak by unknowingly creating new pointers every frame.
                After a lot of searching I found the problem and managed to fix it quite easily.
                <br> <br>
                I am very happy how this project turned out. The final result looks exactly how I wanted, and it proofed to be a nice exercise to explore the sdl2 library and C++ pointers. 
                It also showed that I will need to practice a lot more before being able to create a game myself. 
                But I am excited to learn and explore and will continue to do so in the future.

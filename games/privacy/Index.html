                An ambitious school project
            </h1>
            <p>
                Privacy please is a game I made for an art class project. 
                The theme of the project was privacy and I decided to go over the top and make a whole game around this theme.
                I finished the game in a 2 week holiday and created it in Gamemaker since that was the only thing I had experience with at the time. <br>
                <br>
                The game is about defending the privacy of a boy playing on his laptop. 
                The boy's privacy is being threathend by walking cameras who try to make photos of him.
                The player plays as a cushion spinning around the boy trying to stop the camera flashes from hitting the boy.
                As the game progresses more and more cameras start appearing until the cameras take 3 photos of the boy.
                When this happens the game ends and the player sees the boy in a newspaper with all his private information exposed. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This game ended up being more of a learning experience than an actual fun game. It is far too easy to play and gets boring after a few minutes.
                But making the game did teach me how to finish a game within a strict deadline and gave me more experience with coding and animating.
